# MySQL Module to Godot 4.


### **This module is a wrapper for Boost.MySQL.**

Boost.MySQL is a client for MySQL and MariaDB database servers, based on Boost.Asio.
Boost.MySQL is part of Boost.
This module takes advantage of C++20.
Check out the Boost repository: [Boost.MySQL](https://github.com/boostorg/mysql?tab=readme-ov-file).



##### This module works only with Godot 4.

I have no plans to back port this module to Godot 3.x, but I will accept help from anyone who wants to port it.


##### If you use this module, let me know it. Leave a star ;).

##### Do you have any suggestion? Would you like to share experiences while using the module? Please open a issue.
